Class start:- 

Data and information:-
Any meaningful thing which is present around us in the form of character or number.
The collection of the data is called the information.
Eg. a, b, c,................z, 1, 3, 4, 5, etc


Information: -

The collection of data is known as information.
Eg.

(D  I  N  G  A) -> information
  \ 
Data


Physics: 23       --------> data
Chemistry: 23
Average 75.76 ------------> information

Thoughts :  
Big bucket contains the data and information and will be known as a database.
Any container holding some data and information then it is called the database.
Pc lappy, harddisk etc.

Data -> audio, Binary, text,mp4 , etc.


Before 80 years:--- thoughts 

How they used to manage the data:-

They used to use the file and write it down.
After a certain time, different models are introduced.

The database is storage or container, in which we store the data in an organized manner.
Based on the storing into the database 
The database is classified into 4 different models.
Filesystem database model
Hierarchical database model
Network database Model
Relational Database model


Everywhere the 4 the approach is used. I mean in the industry.

We used to have multiple individual files.
Data redundancy is the first major problem
Searching time is more

What was the issue of this file system model, when it got replaced?

This approach is used during 1950 and 1960, where all the data are
 stored in the form of numerous physical files, where the files had 
no relationship among themselves due to which has following drawbacks.
Data redundancy
Time taken to search for data/info was more.
The file system database model is recommended only if the data
 to be maintained is minimum.

HDM (hirerarchial Database Model)
Top-bottom approach
Top to bottom

In this model, the data or info will be stored in the form of a tree-like structure
 where there will be a partial relationship among the files die to which the data 
redundancy is reduced a bit and searching became little faster, this model was efficient
 only when compared with file system database model else it also had some issued.
Drawbacks:

Data redundancy
Searching time was more because of unidirectional searching(top-down approach).



DBMS:
It is software that is used to store and manage the data present in the database.
Eg, fox pro, based, XML, fox-base… etc.





SQL:-

It is also known as the sequel
SQL stands for the structured query language
It was introduced during the year of 1970 s by dc and rf from IBM.
It is a query language that is provided by RDBMS software to
 the user using which they can manage the data present inside the
 relational database.
SQL is a high-level language.
SQL is case sensitive language.


Figure:- capture 6 

SQL is the query language whereas MySQL is a  relational database.

SQL Terminologies: terms you should know as a database engineer

Entity / relation
Attribute / fields
Records / tuples
Cell


The entity is a real-time object present around us, ………

Data types : 
-> data types are used to specify the type of values and how
 much value to be stored under a column.
Datatypes are used along with the col name while creating the table.
The diff types of datatypes are : 
Capture 7
Numeric Data Types: 

Number(size)
Size represents the number of digits that can be stored.
This data type is used to store any non-floating information.
This data type is used to store information like id, phone number,
 adhar no etc.

SELECT : 

It is a DQL command that is used to display the details of the table.
Using select we can either display all the details or any
 selected details from the table.
To display all the details wee use the * to display the selected details
 we need to specify the column name as shown in the bellow syntax.
To display all the details.
SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME;
To display specific details
 SELECT CN1, CN2, CNN  FIRM TABLE _ NAME;




CREATE TABLE STUDENT(
SID NUMBER(3),
SNAME VARCHAR(10),
SMARKS(4,2)
);

INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(111,’DINGA’,59.30);
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(121,PINGA,79.30);
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(141,’LINGA’,89.30);

SELECT * FROM STUDENT;


SID      SNAME     SMARKS
----------------------------------------
111       DINGA       59.30
121       PINGA       69.30
131       LINGA       89.30


SELECT SID, SNAME FORM STUDENT;

SID      SNAME    
----------------------
111       DINGA  
121       PINGA  
131       LINGA   



>>SHOW  USER;
// SHOW THE CURRENT USER INSIDE THE DATABASE.
>>USER IS “SCOTT”

>>SELECT * FROM TAB;
// DISPLAY ALL THE TABLES PRESENT IN THE DATABASE.

>>DESC TABLE_NAME;
// DISPLAY THE DESCRIPTION / STRUCTURE OF THE TABLE;

>>CLEAR SCREEN;
// TO CLEAR THE SCREEN.



OPERATORS IN SQL : 

OPERATORS ARE USED TO PERFORM SOME OPERATION.
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPERATOR ARE.
Arithmetic operator
 +, -, * , /
Relational operator
<,>,<=,>=, != , = 
Logical operator
AND, OR
Special operator
IN, LIKE, IS, BETWEEN

With respect to arithmetic operator.

2 + 2/2 = 3;

B  O  D  M  A   S  S;

Expressions we have to follow the above BODMAS rule.






Logical operator : 
===============
AND

Both the conditions have to be true, only 
the output will be true.

C1 AND C2  O/P
T             T     -> TRUE
T             F     -> FALSE
F             T      -> FALSE
F             F     -> FALSE


   OR:

C1  OR   C2  O/P
T             T     -> TRUE
T             F     -> TRUE
F             T      -> TRUE
F             F     -> FALSE

At least one of the conditions have to be true,
 only the output will be true.
